## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Didn't learn a whole lot of new stuff this time around. This challenge pretty much employs the same methodologies as used on the Tip Calculator App and the Newsletter Signup Component.

### Continued development

I'm not totally sure if my handling of the form is right.
